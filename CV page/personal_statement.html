        <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Having worked in the hospitality industry for several years, I have decided 
            to leave this industry to pursue a new career in ICT, with a view to 
            specializing in cyber security. Through my years of work in hospitality, 
            I have been able to acquire some skills that can be transferred to my new 
            industry, these include: Quick decision making, being able to learn on the 
            job, time management, organizing and managing workloads, and meeting deadlines.
            Having studied some courses on my chosen subject as well as having a working 
            knowledge of computers and the software readily available, such as the 
            Microsoft Suite of applications.
