        <p>My main hobby I have is gaming, often on PC or on playstation. I find
            these fun while still maintaining my concentration and exposing me to challanges
            in a different enviroment, that often require a different approach. There is
            new research that shows gaming can have real-life benfits. Below I have linked an
            article that explains this in a lot more detail.
